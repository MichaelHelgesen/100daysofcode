# R4 Log
## Day 78: 23.12.19 
* Last day at work before christmas. Worked at our new website. We wanted it to have a design that matches our new offices. It involved a lot of design and flex box. It was fun.

## Day 77: 22.12.19 
* There is a lot of visits today to exchange gifts and dinner party tonight. So I will go through all my Anki cards today, to practice JavaScript, Redux, React and Webpack.

## Day 76: 21.12.19 
* Learned about React useEffect (96%).

## Day 75: 20.12.19 
* Not been much coding today. I did some Scrimba at work, and learned more about React Hooks. I also gave a lot of thought about how I am going to build the next freeCodeCamp projects width React.

## Day 74: 19.12.19 
* Learned about React Hooks (95%). It makes things a lot easier and will probably be the preferred way to handle state in React in the future. Also did challenges on Scrimba.

## Day 73: 18.12.19 
* Finished another section (94%). Only one to go! Also did some Scrimba React challenges.

## Day 72: 17.12.19 
* Finished the styling section of the course! (91%). Only one short section left!

## Day 71: 16.12.19 
* More styling and more challenges (88%). Also did challenges on Scrimba. I am planning my next React project in my head.

## Day 70: 15.12.19 
* Day 70! Yay! Continued the styling (86%). No problems today. Pretty easy really.

## Day 69: 14.12.19 
* Got the app working again. I just couldn't let it go. I located what caused the error and commented it out. Now I am able to continue the styling.

## Day 68: 13.12.19 
* Tried to copy the source files to fix the application, but I didn't get it to work. Did some more styling for what did work. 

## Day 67: 12.12.19 
* Started to style the app, but there is a lot that is not working... I think I need to use the source files to be able to continue. I have no idea where the errors are.

## Day 66: 11.12.19 
* YES! Finished the authentication and testing section of the course (85%. Now on to styling. It's nice to do something else than bug fixing for a while. 

## Day 65: 10.12.19 
* Trying to finish the course. Implementing authentication and login/logout (83%).

## Day 64: 09.12.19 
* Home with sick child today, so I managed to do a lot of coding while she was sleeping and relaxing in front of the TV. I can't wait to finish this course and start building stuff... (82%)

## Day 63: 08.12.19 
* Continued the course (79%). Just one video away from finishing all the test cases!

## Day 62: 07.12.19 
* Not working... again. And I can't continue the course... I even downloaded the source files without luck. Did some Scrimba instead.

## Day 61: 06.12.19 
* Not been coding a lot today, but I've been working with responsive design, user interface and design. We sent the design to a customer. Had a lot of discussions. I felt that I contributed pretty well.

## Day 60: 05.12.19 
* Day 60! Yay. I should be done with the course though. But it's so dofficult.
* Stuck with a bug again... Didn't manage to solve it. Must ber a typo somewhere.
* Worked with responsive design at work. Used a lot of CSS techniques.

## Day 59: 04.12.19 
* Setup of new Firebase Database test server (78%). Jest, Webpack, testing... it's not the most fun stuff I've been doing. But I see why it's important. I'm just unsure about the add-ons. With so many plugins, there has to be so much to keep up to date? Security issues? Need to learn more about this.
* Made a new web page at work. Used a lot of flexbox.

## Day 58: 03.12.19 
* I fixed all the problems and managed to continue the course (77%).
* Got a little time off at work today, so I did some coding in the Scrimba course.

## Day 57: 02.12.19 
* I just had to take a break from the Udemy course and all the test cases. As mentioned yersterday I can't push to Git, and there is a bug in my test case. So today I spent about three hours doing the React Course on Scrimba. Nice repetition. I actually do remember quite a bit!

## Day 56: 01.12.19 
* When trying to push to Git today, I was suddenly told that there was no place to push to... so I spent a lot of time trying to solve it, without luck. Need to continue tomorrow. Arg! So many bugs and errors slowing me down. But it's not a sprint. It's a marathon... 

## Day 55: 30.11.19 
* More bugs, error fixing and installing even more libraries: react-mock store to create a mock store to test against.

## Day 54: 29.11.19 
* The testing brings sooo much bugs! Arg! Driving me crazy. But I'll continue tomorrow.

## Day 53: 28.11.19 
* Continued learning about Firebase (76%).
* Started a new section; integrating Redux with Firebase. Pretty complex. 

## Day 52: 27.11.19 
* Continued learning about Firebase (74%). Learned that Firebase does'nt support arrays, so we have to work with objects instead.

## Day 51: 26.11.19 
* Continued learning about Firebase (74%). It's super fun. I've been looking forward to learning about connecting to a database. It's simple enough at this point. Seems like a perfect match for React and Redux.

## Day 50: 25.11.19 
* Day 50! Yay. Firebase is pretty cool (71%). I spent a lot of time again fixing bugs and getting Git to work. This has become a bug galore. But I've managed to fix them. Thats good.

## Day 49: 24.11.19 
* Finished the Deploying section and started the Firebase section (70%). Adding a server from Google. That's cool! I've wanted to learn to use databases for a long time.

## Day 48: 23.11.19 
* Did a challenge in the morning. Didn't have so much time today. But did another video.

## Day 47: 22.11.19 
* Was stopped by some Git error again... but solved it (69%). It takes so much time from the coding. But I guess it's good learning anyway.
* Finished responsive web page at work.

## Day 46: 21.11.19 
* Fixed the bug and managed to continue the course.
* A lot of webdesign at work. Mostly making a webpage responsive.

## Day 45: 20.11.19 
* I am still on the same video. Spent all evening trying to solve a build bug with Heroku. I didn't manage to solve it.
* Did a lot of Flex box and webdesign at work.
* Got positive feedback from customer. That's always nice.

## Day 44: 19.11.19 
* Continnued the course (67%). Learned to create separate CSS files and setting up a production web server with Express. The last part failed, and I did not manage to fix it. I will continue tomorrow.

## Day 43: 18.11.19 
* Learned about Git and production and developement using Webpack (66%). This is also very complicated. I guess most things are, when you don't know them. So got to keep on...
* Managed to turn the unhappy customer happy again.

## Day 42: 17.11.19 
* Finished the testing section and moved on to the deploying section (65%). At this point it feels like I've forgotten everything about React. I will probably need to start this course all over again. That tells me I'm going about this the wrong way, again. But for now I will stick to the plan. Im soon done, and then I'll start building stuff.

## Day 41: 16.11.19 
* Doing advanced testing of components (62%). This is getting very challenging. I do not think I will be able to do the last test challenge.

## Day 40: 15.11.19 
* Day 40! Yay!
* Finished the React and Redux section on fCC! Now there is five challenges waiting. That's going to take some time. I need to build it with React and Redux if I manage.
* Studied my Anki cards.

## Day 39: 14.11.19 
* A lot more testing (61%). I'm struggeling to keep up. But I will go on. I will finish this. Learned about a lot of other methods and tools.
* Bought a React course on Scrimba to check out the service. Looks exciting. But at the same time I realise that I may be in tutorial hell. I new to build stuff... Damn, I sound like a broken record.
* Delivered the webpage to the client for approval today. Still more work to be done though.

## Day 38: 13.11.19 
* Continued the course (60%). I can't believe all the additional libraries that we should use with React. This projects gets so big and complex. I really don't know if I will ever be able to use any of it. But at least it gives me a better overview of how it all connects.
* More CSS, HTML and Flexbox at work.

## Day 37: 12.11.19 
* These test videos sure are long and complicated (59%). I also got a lot of bugs to fix today. At least I am searching through code and interacting with it. I managed to fix it all in the end.
* Started to test components.
* And even more CSS and HTML at work. Also some javascript. Mostly about relocating elements that the CMS generated into other elements that I created to be able to get the layout I wanted. 

## Day 36: 11.11.19 
* More nasty bugs all over the place! My test cases keep failing. After reading about it in this sections comment field I found the answer. I could finally continue to the next video (57%).
* Did a lot of CSS and Flexbox at work.

## Day 35: 10.11.19 
* Spent most of today trying to fix a bug. I couldn't figure it out, so I had to copy the source material. 
* Did one more lesson (57%).

## Day 34: 09.11.19 
* I spent most of my coding session trying to solve challenges and then trying to solve a bug. I just can't understand why my Jest breaks. I'll try again tomorrow. 
* Studied my Anki cards.

## Day 33: 08.11.19 
* More Jest in the React course (56%). Pretty complex, but quite fun. I didn't expect that. Long videos and a lot of challenges that takes time. 
* Did a lot of flexbox at work today. It's really fast and fun when you get the hang of it. It so much more flexible and smooth compared to floats and positioning.

## Day 32: 07.11.19 
* Learned about Jest in the React course (56%). That was exciting. Now I understand a little more about testing. Will be interesting to continue.
* Finished the filtering, the word search, click to open functionality and layout on a webpage project at work.

## Day 31: 06.11.19 
* Learned about Redux developer tool and did some more filtering in the React course (55%).
* Finished the filtering at work as well. I got all the features working. Now all that is left is to add word search on top of that.

## Day 30: 05.11.19 
* 30 days! I'm happy about that. At the same time I am really scared about how much I suck, again, after all this time. But I guess it just has to do with exposure. I guess I am learning even though I feel like the worst programmer in the world.
* Continued the course, setting up Redux (53%). Got stuck again with an error. Trying to locate it.
* Did some filtering at work. Filtered DOM-elements and re-rendered them.

## Day 29: 04.11.19 
* Continued the React course working with moment.js and Airbnbs React date picker (53%). It went well for a while, but suddenly I got a huge error, and everything stopped working. It was a typo of course. So I fixed it and went on. 
* Started the Redux and React challenge on fCC. Got stuck.
* Studied Anki cards.

## Day 28: 03.11.19 
* Continued connecting React and Redux (52%). I will never remember any of this. And that is maybe not the point. I guess I should use this course as a reference when needed. I notice that doing React stuff is so many lessons ago that I am starting to forget. Maybe I should do the courses in parts, and build stuff between the sections. But then I am afraid that I forget what I was doing when jumping back in. I will do this whole course now, and reflect on it then.
* Finished Redux challenges in fCC.

## Day 27: 02.11.19 
* Connecting React and Redux. This is starting to get super complicated! I am now 50% into the course. If I continue this pace, I will be done when I am half way in round 4 of #100DaysOfCode. I will spend those 50 days on building my own stuff with what I've learned.
* Did a couple of fCC challenges.
* Studied my Anki cards.

## Day 26: 01.11.19 
* Started a new section in the Udemy React course. Grinding on! Will now connect React and Redux.
* Studied Anki cards.
* Set up a Programming Wiki in Notion.

## Day 25: 31.10.19 
* Happy Halloween! Finished the section on Redux in isolation in the Udemy React course (48%). Next up, the React and Redux will be put together. I think I got a good understanding of Redux, I just need to use it in projects to learn it better.
* Studied my Anki cards.
* Started gathering programming resources in Notion. I think I will make the switch from OneNote.

## Day 24: 30.10.19 
* Learned a lot more about Redux reducers and actions and combining reducers in the Udemy React course (46%).
* Struggled a lot with javascript filtering in a project at work. I did something even more advanced a month ago, but it all seems to be lost from my mind already. It's really not a big thing, and I should be able to solve it without much trouble. Experiencing this makes me just want to quit it all. i ended up thinking I'll never be any good at this. Let's hope it comes back to me tomorrow.
* Studied my Anki cards.
* Did some Redux challenges in fCC.

## Day 23: 29.10.19 
* Finished chapter 5 in Eloquent Javascript. Can't say I understood much. Very complicated examples. But I'll give the exercises a try nonetheless.
* Continued learning about destructuring and then back to Redux (45%) (which is also very difficult).
* Did a lot of Flexbox at work today.
* I was handed a layout that will require some (for me) heavy javascript programming. It's about filtering and sorting. It will be good practice. I only hope that I am able to make it work!


## Day 22: 28.10.19 
* Continued my React course (44%). Learned more about Redux plus destructuring.
* Did some javascript and a lot of HTML and CSS at work. That was fun. Flexbox is really beginning to stick. I work a lot faster now.

## Day 21: 27.10.19 
* Started the next section in the Udemy React course (43%). It is about Redux, which is a way to handle state for more complex apps. 
* Did a couple of fCC Redux challenges as I was going through the Udemy course. I find that having several sources when learning something new actually helps me grasp it faster. 
* Studied Anki cards.


## Day 20: 26.10.19 
* Day 20! YAY!
* Read a message from my friend Klara. That was sweet and encouraging.
* Finished the routing section in the Udemy React course (41%). It was about client side routing and setting up links. It was very cool. This way makes sites blazingly fast.
* It will be fun to try and build a web page with this technology.
* Started the next chapter in Eloquent Javascript. I have to say... that book is almost to advanced for me to read. Such complicated examples and way of explaining, but I have learned a bit from the exercises so I'll at least try a couple of more chapters.

## Day 19: 25.10.19 
* Started a new section in the Udemy React Course (37%). It's about routing. It seems like an advanced section, but it'll be exciting to go through it. I think I will be able to learn a lot.
* Studied my Anki cards. 

## Day 18: 24.10.19 
* Continued the styling section of the Udemy React course (35%)
* Finished the last challenge in the Eloquent Javascript book in chapter 4. I couldn't solve it, but I was not far away from one of the solutions. The solution in the book was way over my head. It was a disappointment but I didn't let it get to me the way I did a couple of days ago.
* Started a new chapter in Eloquent JAvascript.

## Day 17: 23.10.19 
* Continued the styling section of the Udemy React course (33%)
* Spent most of the day trying to do the chapter challenges in Eloquent Javascript. It went a bit better today. I managed to solve some recursion challenges and I learned a lot about objects, functions and different expressions in loops.

## Day 16: 22.10.19 
* I spent most of the day trying to find a solution to what turned out to be a very easy exercise. I feel so stupid and I feel that I will NEVER EVER be able to do this for a living. I feel frustrated.
* Solved the first part of the first exercise in chapter 3 in Eloquent Javascript. I think I am trying to hard to find clever and smart solutions. I have to change my mindset. I have to focus on understanding what I need to do, then I need to get it done, no matter what, even if the solution is not the best or smartest or most effective. That way I will never do this...
* One positive thing that came out of this was that I learned a lot about recursion and had a couple of a-ha moments. I used recursion without looking it up.
* Answered a code question on the fCC forums and asked a question.
* Started the styling section of the Udemy React course (33%)

## Day 15: 21.10.19 
* I got to code during most of my workday, so I've spent many hours with programming today.
* Did fCC's React challenges again. It was obviously a lot easier the second time around and after the React course on Udemy. It was nice to get some repetition. 
* Finished all the new fCC challenges in the courses I had finished before the fCC update.
* Finished another chapter in Eloquent Javascript book.
* Finished the section "using a third-party component" in the Udemy course (31%).
* Added cards to Anki, and studied for 30 minutes. I am not sure of the effect of Anki yet. I am not sure if the cards I make are good enough. I think I need to ask more open questions. It seems that I am just learning what answer belongs to what card, instead of learning and remembering what it actually says. Maybe that don't make much sense, but it's something about the context. But I guess my mind picks up something. At least I hope so.

## Day 14: 20.10.19 
* More webpack. I installed Babel, Source Maps and Dev server. It is just so much, and so complicated. But I see the value of it. But I will never be able to reproduce all this without following a guide, so I just work through it to get back to the React part.
* Finished the Webpack section in the Udemy React course (28%).

## Day 13: 19.10.19 
* Finished learning about Webpack. I find it breaks up the React learning a bit, but I'll continue on (26%).
* Learned that Webpack is about exporting and importing files and values. It seems a bit complicated.
* Learned to import third party libraries (npm modules (React and ReactDOM)).
* Read more in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.

## Day 12: 18.10.19 
* Finished the second chapter of Eloquent Javascript.
* Did all three chapter challenges in Eloquent Javascript.
* Leaned about Webpack. Pretty complicated...
* 25% progress in the Udemy React course.
* Bought a GraphQL course on Udemy.

## Day 11: 17.10.19 
* Finished the Udemy React course "stateless functional component" section (23%).
* Re-watched the videos about state, props and super in classes.
* Added a lot of cards to Anki.
* I saw that there is new challenges in the new fCC. Several about recursion, which I hadden to try to figure out. That was perfect timing!

## Day 10: 16.10.19 
* First 10 days! Yay!
* 20% on Udemy React course.
* Studied recursion. I read about it in Eloquent Javascript, and looked up several videos to get a better understanding of it. It's a bit difficult to grasp. In short: a function that calls itself inside of the function body. Can be used as an alternative to loops.
* Added cards to Anki.
* fCC updated their pages and curriculum!

## Day 9: 15.10.19 
* Learned more about states and about the differences between state and props.
* Finished several challenges.
* Watched 3 Udemy React videos (19%).
* Did 3 fCC React challenges.

## Day 8: 14.10.19 
* Learned more about states, and learned to use it. I also finished a challenge, converting an earlier app to an app using React module and state manipulation.
* 3 more videos in the Udemy React course (17%).
* Read more about functions in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.
* Finished copying all my blogposts from Hugo to Gatsby.

## Day 7: 13.10.19 
* Learned about events and methods and method binding in React. Binding is a bit tough to grasp, so I need to work more with that. It has to do width breaking the "this" binding in methods in the React components. To fix it we have to bind the methods using "bind()" in the constructor function. We must also call super inside the constructor.
* Learned about "state" in React. This is the way it works:
    1. Setup default state object.
    2. Component rendered with default state values.
    3. Change state based on event.
    4. Component re-rendered using new state values.
    5. Start again at 3.
* Watched 4 videos in the Udemy React course (16%).

## Day 6: 12.10.19 
* Learned about React components, nesting components and component props. Very fun and interesting way to build an app. Starting to get advanced though. I repeated sections of several videos to understand the different consepts.
* Watched 3 videos in the Udemy course (14%).
* Did 9 freeCodeCamp React challenges.
* Started a new chapter in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.
* Learned about lists in Computer Science.

## Day 5: 11.10.19 
* Learned about classes and template strings in JS again. Useful when continuing React.
* Did some JS class challenges.
* Did more Udemy React videos (12%).
* Learned about binary (bit, byte) and hexadecimals.

## Day 4: 10.10.19 
* Did all three challenges from chapter one in Eloquent Javascript.
* Did a "Build it" challenge in the Udemy React course.
* Discovered and started to listen to the podcast "baseCS".
* Added cards to Anki.
* Finished a couple of videos in the Udemy React course (10%).
* Copied over more blog posts to new blog.

* Events and attributes, arrays, forms and data binding in the React course from Udemy (9%).
* Added a lot of cards in my Anki decks.
* Did some simple React challenges.
* Copied over more blog posts.
* Listened to episodes of Syntax.
* Read in Eloquent JavaScript book.

## Day 2: 08.10.19 
* Recap of ES6 functions (Udemy React Course): const, let and arrow functions.
* Added a lot of cards in my Anki decks.
* Did some simple ES6 challenges.
* Copied over more blog posts.

## Day 1: 07.10.19 
* Learned about JSX. The template must return a single element.
* Learned ReactDOM.render(JSX, targetNode).
* Finished a couple of videos in the React course.
* Finished six freeCodeCamp React challenges.
* Added cards in my React deck in Anki.
* Started copying content from Forestry to Contentful.
