# R4 Log
## Day 17: 23.10.19 
* Continued the styling section of the Udemy React course (33%)
* Spent most of the day trying to do the chapter challenges in Eloquent Javascript. It went a bit better today. I managed to solve some recursion challenges and I learned a lot about objects, functions and different expressions in loops.

## Day 16: 22.10.19 
* I spent most of the day trying to find a solution to what turned out to be a very easy exercise. I feel so stupid and I feel that I will NEVER EVER be able to do this for a living. I feel frustrated.
* Solved the first part of the first exercise in chapter 3 in Eloquent Javascript. I think I am trying to hard to find clever and smart solutions. I have to change my mindset. I have to focus on understanding what I need to do, then I need to get it done, no matter what, even if the solution is not the best or smartest or most effective. That way I will never do this...
* One positive thing that came out of this was that I learned a lot about recursion and had a couple of a-ha moments. I used recursion without looking it up.
* Answered a code question on the fCC forums and asked a question.
* Started the styling section of the Udemy React course (33%)

## Day 15: 21.10.19 
* I got to code during most of my workday, so I've spent many hours with programming today.
* Did fCC's React challenges again. It was obviously a lot easier the second time around and after the React course on Udemy. It was nice to get some repetition. 
* Finished all the new fCC challenges in the courses I had finished before the fCC update.
* Finished another chapter in Eloquent Javascript book.
* Finished the section "using a third-party component" in the Udemy course (31%).
* Added cards to Anki, and studied for 30 minutes. I am not sure of the effect of Anki yet. I am not sure if the cards I make are good enough. I think I need to ask more open questions. It seems that I am just learning what answer belongs to what card, instead of learning and remembering what it actually says. Maybe that don't make much sense, but it's something about the context. But I guess my mind picks up something. At least I hope so.

## Day 14: 20.10.19 
* More webpack. I installed Babel, Source Maps and Dev server. It is just so much, and so complicated. But I see the value of it. But I will never be able to reproduce all this without following a guide, so I just work through it to get back to the React part.
* Finished the Webpack section in the Udemy React course (28%).

## Day 13: 19.10.19 
* Finished learning about Webpack. I find it breaks up the React learning a bit, but I'll continue on (26%).
* Learned that Webpack is about exporting and importing files and values. It seems a bit complicated.
* Learned to import third party libraries (npm modules (React and ReactDOM)).
* Read more in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.

## Day 12: 18.10.19 
* Finished the second chapter of Eloquent Javascript.
* Did all three chapter challenges in Eloquent Javascript.
* Leaned about Webpack. Pretty complicated...
* 25% progress in the Udemy React course.
* Bought a GraphQL course on Udemy.

## Day 11: 17.10.19 
* Finished the Udemy React course "stateless functional component" section (23%).
* Re-watched the videos about state, props and super in classes.
* Added a lot of cards to Anki.
* I saw that there is new challenges in the new fCC. Several about recursion, which I hadden to try to figure out. That was perfect timing!

## Day 10: 16.10.19 
* First 10 days! Yay!
* 20% on Udemy React course.
* Studied recursion. I read about it in Eloquent Javascript, and looked up several videos to get a better understanding of it. It's a bit difficult to grasp. In short: a function that calls itself inside of the function body. Can be used as an alternative to loops.
* Added cards to Anki.
* fCC updated their pages and curriculum!

## Day 9: 15.10.19 
* Learned more about states and about the differences between state and props.
* Finished several challenges.
* Watched 3 Udemy React videos (19%).
* Did 3 fCC React challenges.

## Day 8: 14.10.19 
* Learned more about states, and learned to use it. I also finished a challenge, converting an earlier app to an app using React module and state manipulation.
* 3 more videos in the Udemy React course (17%).
* Read more about functions in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.
* Finished copying all my blogposts from Hugo to Gatsby.

## Day 7: 13.10.19 
* Learned about events and methods and method binding in React. Binding is a bit tough to grasp, so I need to work more with that. It has to do width breaking the "this" binding in methods in the React components. To fix it we have to bind the methods using "bind()" in the constructor function. We must also call super inside the constructor.
* Learned about "state" in React. This is the way it works:
    1. Setup default state object.
    2. Component rendered with default state values.
    3. Change state based on event.
    4. Component re-rendered using new state values.
    5. Start again at 3.
* Watched 4 videos in the Udemy React course (16%).

## Day 6: 12.10.19 
* Learned about React components, nesting components and component props. Very fun and interesting way to build an app. Starting to get advanced though. I repeated sections of several videos to understand the different consepts.
* Watched 3 videos in the Udemy course (14%).
* Did 9 freeCodeCamp React challenges.
* Started a new chapter in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.
* Learned about lists in Computer Science.

## Day 5: 11.10.19 
* Learned about classes and template strings in JS again. Useful when continuing React.
* Did some JS class challenges.
* Did more Udemy React videos (12%).
* Learned about binary (bit, byte) and hexadecimals.

## Day 4: 10.10.19 
* Did all three challenges from chapter one in Eloquent Javascript.
* Did a "Build it" challenge in the Udemy React course.
* Discovered and started to listen to the podcast "baseCS".
* Added cards to Anki.
* Finished a couple of videos in the Udemy React course (10%).
* Copied over more blog posts to new blog.

## Day 3: 09.10.19 
* Events and attributes, arrays, forms and data binding in the React course from Udemy (9%).
* Added a lot of cards in my Anki decks.
* Did some simple React challenges.
* Copied over more blog posts.
* Listened to episodes of Syntax.
* Read in Eloquent JavaScript book.

## Day 2: 08.10.19 
* Recap of ES6 functions (Udemy React Course): const, let and arrow functions.
* Added a lot of cards in my Anki decks.
* Did some simple ES6 challenges.
* Copied over more blog posts.

## Day 1: 07.10.19 
* Learned about JSX. The template must return a single element.
* Learned ReactDOM.render(JSX, targetNode).
* Finished a couple of videos in the React course.
* Finished six freeCodeCamp React challenges.
* Added cards in my React deck in Anki.
* Started copying content from Forestry to Contentful.
