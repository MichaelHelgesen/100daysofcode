# R4 Log
## Day 34: 09.11.19 
* I spent most of my coding session trying to solve challenges and then trying to solve a bug. I just can't understand why my Jest breaks. I'll try again tomorrow. 
* Studied my Anki cards.

## Day 33: 08.11.19 
* More Jest in the React course (56%). Pretty complex, but quite fun. I didn't expect that. Long videos and a lot of challenges that takes time. 
* Did a lot of flexbox at work today. It's really fast and fun when you get the hang of it. It so much more flexible and smooth compared to floats and positioning.

## Day 32: 07.11.19 
* Learned about Jest in the React course (56%). That was exciting. Now I understand a little more about testing. Will be interesting to continue.
* Finished the filtering, the word search, click to open functionality and layout on a webpage project at work.

## Day 31: 06.11.19 
* Learned about Redux developer tool and did some more filtering in the React course (55%).
* Finished the filtering at work as well. I got all the features working. Now all that is left is to add word search on top of that.

## Day 30: 05.11.19 
* 30 days! I'm happy about that. At the same time I am really scared about how much I suck, again, after all this time. But I guess it just has to do with exposure. I guess I am learning even though I feel like the worst programmer in the world.
* Continued the course, setting up Redux (53%). Got stuck again with an error. Trying to locate it.
* Did some filtering at work. Filtered DOM-elements and re-rendered them.

## Day 29: 04.11.19 
* Continued the React course working with moment.js and Airbnbs React date picker (53%). It went well for a while, but suddenly I got a huge error, and everything stopped working. It was a typo of course. So I fixed it and went on. 
* Started the Redux and React challenge on fCC. Got stuck.
* Studied Anki cards.

## Day 28: 03.11.19 
* Continued connecting React and Redux (52%). I will never remember any of this. And that is maybe not the point. I guess I should use this course as a reference when needed. I notice that doing React stuff is so many lessons ago that I am starting to forget. Maybe I should do the courses in parts, and build stuff between the sections. But then I am afraid that I forget what I was doing when jumping back in. I will do this whole course now, and reflect on it then.
* Finished Redux challenges in fCC.

## Day 27: 02.11.19 
* Connecting React and Redux. This is starting to get super complicated! I am now 50% into the course. If I continue this pace, I will be done when I am half way in round 4 of #100DaysOfCode. I will spend those 50 days on building my own stuff with what I've learned.
* Did a couple of fCC challenges.
* Studied my Anki cards.

## Day 26: 01.11.19 
* Started a new section in the Udemy React course. Grinding on! Will now connect React and Redux.
* Studied Anki cards.
* Set up a Programming Wiki in Notion.

## Day 25: 31.10.19 
* Happy Halloween! Finished the section on Redux in isolation in the Udemy React course (48%). Next up, the React and Redux will be put together. I think I got a good understanding of Redux, I just need to use it in projects to learn it better.
* Studied my Anki cards.
* Started gathering programming resources in Notion. I think I will make the switch from OneNote.

## Day 24: 30.10.19 
* Learned a lot more about Redux reducers and actions and combining reducers in the Udemy React course (46%).
* Struggled a lot with javascript filtering in a project at work. I did something even more advanced a month ago, but it all seems to be lost from my mind already. It's really not a big thing, and I should be able to solve it without much trouble. Experiencing this makes me just want to quit it all. i ended up thinking I'll never be any good at this. Let's hope it comes back to me tomorrow.
* Studied my Anki cards.
* Did some Redux challenges in fCC.

## Day 23: 29.10.19 
* Finished chapter 5 in Eloquent Javascript. Can't say I understood much. Very complicated examples. But I'll give the exercises a try nonetheless.
* Continued learning about destructuring and then back to Redux (45%) (which is also very difficult).
* Did a lot of Flexbox at work today.
* I was handed a layout that will require some (for me) heavy javascript programming. It's about filtering and sorting. It will be good practice. I only hope that I am able to make it work!


## Day 22: 28.10.19 
* Continued my React course (44%). Learned more about Redux plus destructuring.
* Did some javascript and a lot of HTML and CSS at work. That was fun. Flexbox is really beginning to stick. I work a lot faster now.

## Day 21: 27.10.19 
* Started the next section in the Udemy React course (43%). It is about Redux, which is a way to handle state for more complex apps. 
* Did a couple of fCC Redux challenges as I was going through the Udemy course. I find that having several sources when learning something new actually helps me grasp it faster. 
* Studied Anki cards.


## Day 20: 26.10.19 
* Day 20! YAY!
* Read a message from my friend Klara. That was sweet and encouraging.
* Finished the routing section in the Udemy React course (41%). It was about client side routing and setting up links. It was very cool. This way makes sites blazingly fast.
* It will be fun to try and build a web page with this technology.
* Started the next chapter in Eloquent Javascript. I have to say... that book is almost to advanced for me to read. Such complicated examples and way of explaining, but I have learned a bit from the exercises so I'll at least try a couple of more chapters.

## Day 19: 25.10.19 
* Started a new section in the Udemy React Course (37%). It's about routing. It seems like an advanced section, but it'll be exciting to go through it. I think I will be able to learn a lot.
* Studied my Anki cards. 

## Day 18: 24.10.19 
* Continued the styling section of the Udemy React course (35%)
* Finished the last challenge in the Eloquent Javascript book in chapter 4. I couldn't solve it, but I was not far away from one of the solutions. The solution in the book was way over my head. It was a disappointment but I didn't let it get to me the way I did a couple of days ago.
* Started a new chapter in Eloquent JAvascript.

## Day 17: 23.10.19 
* Continued the styling section of the Udemy React course (33%)
* Spent most of the day trying to do the chapter challenges in Eloquent Javascript. It went a bit better today. I managed to solve some recursion challenges and I learned a lot about objects, functions and different expressions in loops.

## Day 16: 22.10.19 
* I spent most of the day trying to find a solution to what turned out to be a very easy exercise. I feel so stupid and I feel that I will NEVER EVER be able to do this for a living. I feel frustrated.
* Solved the first part of the first exercise in chapter 3 in Eloquent Javascript. I think I am trying to hard to find clever and smart solutions. I have to change my mindset. I have to focus on understanding what I need to do, then I need to get it done, no matter what, even if the solution is not the best or smartest or most effective. That way I will never do this...
* One positive thing that came out of this was that I learned a lot about recursion and had a couple of a-ha moments. I used recursion without looking it up.
* Answered a code question on the fCC forums and asked a question.
* Started the styling section of the Udemy React course (33%)

## Day 15: 21.10.19 
* I got to code during most of my workday, so I've spent many hours with programming today.
* Did fCC's React challenges again. It was obviously a lot easier the second time around and after the React course on Udemy. It was nice to get some repetition. 
* Finished all the new fCC challenges in the courses I had finished before the fCC update.
* Finished another chapter in Eloquent Javascript book.
* Finished the section "using a third-party component" in the Udemy course (31%).
* Added cards to Anki, and studied for 30 minutes. I am not sure of the effect of Anki yet. I am not sure if the cards I make are good enough. I think I need to ask more open questions. It seems that I am just learning what answer belongs to what card, instead of learning and remembering what it actually says. Maybe that don't make much sense, but it's something about the context. But I guess my mind picks up something. At least I hope so.

## Day 14: 20.10.19 
* More webpack. I installed Babel, Source Maps and Dev server. It is just so much, and so complicated. But I see the value of it. But I will never be able to reproduce all this without following a guide, so I just work through it to get back to the React part.
* Finished the Webpack section in the Udemy React course (28%).

## Day 13: 19.10.19 
* Finished learning about Webpack. I find it breaks up the React learning a bit, but I'll continue on (26%).
* Learned that Webpack is about exporting and importing files and values. It seems a bit complicated.
* Learned to import third party libraries (npm modules (React and ReactDOM)).
* Read more in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.

## Day 12: 18.10.19 
* Finished the second chapter of Eloquent Javascript.
* Did all three chapter challenges in Eloquent Javascript.
* Leaned about Webpack. Pretty complicated...
* 25% progress in the Udemy React course.
* Bought a GraphQL course on Udemy.

## Day 11: 17.10.19 
* Finished the Udemy React course "stateless functional component" section (23%).
* Re-watched the videos about state, props and super in classes.
* Added a lot of cards to Anki.
* I saw that there is new challenges in the new fCC. Several about recursion, which I hadden to try to figure out. That was perfect timing!

## Day 10: 16.10.19 
* First 10 days! Yay!
* 20% on Udemy React course.
* Studied recursion. I read about it in Eloquent Javascript, and looked up several videos to get a better understanding of it. It's a bit difficult to grasp. In short: a function that calls itself inside of the function body. Can be used as an alternative to loops.
* Added cards to Anki.
* fCC updated their pages and curriculum!

## Day 9: 15.10.19 
* Learned more about states and about the differences between state and props.
* Finished several challenges.
* Watched 3 Udemy React videos (19%).
* Did 3 fCC React challenges.

## Day 8: 14.10.19 
* Learned more about states, and learned to use it. I also finished a challenge, converting an earlier app to an app using React module and state manipulation.
* 3 more videos in the Udemy React course (17%).
* Read more about functions in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.
* Finished copying all my blogposts from Hugo to Gatsby.

## Day 7: 13.10.19 
* Learned about events and methods and method binding in React. Binding is a bit tough to grasp, so I need to work more with that. It has to do width breaking the "this" binding in methods in the React components. To fix it we have to bind the methods using "bind()" in the constructor function. We must also call super inside the constructor.
* Learned about "state" in React. This is the way it works:
    1. Setup default state object.
    2. Component rendered with default state values.
    3. Change state based on event.
    4. Component re-rendered using new state values.
    5. Start again at 3.
* Watched 4 videos in the Udemy React course (16%).

## Day 6: 12.10.19 
* Learned about React components, nesting components and component props. Very fun and interesting way to build an app. Starting to get advanced though. I repeated sections of several videos to understand the different consepts.
* Watched 3 videos in the Udemy course (14%).
* Did 9 freeCodeCamp React challenges.
* Started a new chapter in Eloquent Javascript.
* Added cards to Anki.
* Learned about lists in Computer Science.

## Day 5: 11.10.19 
* Learned about classes and template strings in JS again. Useful when continuing React.
* Did some JS class challenges.
* Did more Udemy React videos (12%).
* Learned about binary (bit, byte) and hexadecimals.

## Day 4: 10.10.19 
* Did all three challenges from chapter one in Eloquent Javascript.
* Did a "Build it" challenge in the Udemy React course.
* Discovered and started to listen to the podcast "baseCS".
* Added cards to Anki.
* Finished a couple of videos in the Udemy React course (10%).
* Copied over more blog posts to new blog.

* Added a lot of cards in my Anki decks.
* Did some simple ES6 challenges.
* Copied over more blog posts.

## Day 1: 07.10.19 
* Learned about JSX. The template must return a single element.
* Learned ReactDOM.render(JSX, targetNode).
* Finished a couple of videos in the React course.
* Finished six freeCodeCamp React challenges.
* Added cards in my React deck in Anki.
* Started copying content from Forestry to Contentful.
