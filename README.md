# 100daysofcode Round 3
*Start date: 1. may 2018*

## My goals

This round I'm going to up my game and allocate more time to coding and writing. That's what motivates me the most and it's highly relevant. Working in a digital agency has me experiencing the need for programming skills every day, and the writing makes me learn better.

In round 2 my goal was to build a working program from my own idea every month (I also learned Sass and Git), as opposed to round 1, where it was all about learning from scratch and copying the tutorials.

 I found that, while I learned a lot, I learned even more by building my own stuff and Googling for solutions. That's why I hoped to combine tutorials and creating my own stuff in round 3, but I really feel that I need to relearn some JS concepts so that I don't get stuck using the basics. And I really want to be able to save stuff to server.

 ### So my plan is as follows:

 * Deepen my knowledge of JavaScript fundementals.
 * Learn how to connect a server (backend).
 *  Figure out a workflow with VS Code and GitHub and stick to it. 
 * Learn and use as many hotkeys as possible in VS Code.
 * Build something (hopefully with Node.js).

## Rules 

### Commitment

**_For the next 100 days, I will code at least 1.5 hours each day._**

#### Additional rules:
1. I will log my progress daily on GitHub.
2. Everything code related counts.
3. More than two days off in a row, and the challenge is lost.


## Other
More focus on programming and my continued quest for blogging means I need to cut back on other things. So for now, these will be my changes:
* Update the blog and write whatever I feel like, without beeing afraid or nervous. It's first and foremost going to be a blog *by* and *for* myself :relieved:. 
I will not post links to it, monetize on it, work with SEO or adwords and the like. It will not be a brand and I will not pick a niche. The reason beeing that I don't want to forget where the line is that separates my fictions from reality. It will only be me. For now.
