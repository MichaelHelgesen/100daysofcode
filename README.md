## Rules 

### Commitment

**_For the next 100 days I will do something related to programming._**

#### Additional rules:
1. I will log my progress daily on GitHub and on my blog.
2. Everything code related counts.
3. More than two days off in a row, and the challenge is lost.

## Other
More focus on programming and my continued quest for blogging means I need to cut back on other things. So for now, these will be my changes:
* Continue the blog and write whatever I feel like, without beeing afraid or nervous. It's first and foremost going to be a blog *by* and *for* myself :relieved:. 
I will not post links to it, monetize on it, work with SEO or adwords and the like. It will not be a brand and I will not pick a niche. The reason beeing that I don't want to forget where the line is that separates my fictions from reality. It will only be me. For now.

* Keep up with the workout, reading, guitar lessons, bullet journaling and family time. 
* Less time on YouTube.
* Continue to stay away from distractions like social media, TV, gaming and other.
