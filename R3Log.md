### D1 #100DaysOfCode - 1.5.18
*Morning (04.45 - 06.36):*

* Continued my Node course on Udemy, building a weather app. It's fetching the address and live weather data via APIs. That is super cool, and it's so exciting to finally get some experience connecting things together through HTTP requests and APIs. 
* Installed [JSON view](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome) Chrome extension. Super useful when working with JSON data.
* I've used a lot of callback functions in this project. I need to get a better understanding of how that works in relation to the call stack, event loop etc.  
* I managed to solve all the challenges the instructor gave. 

*Evening:*
* Updated the theme on my WP-blog.
* Updated my GitHub Log and README for round 3.
* Learnt the GitHub markdown and GitHub emoji markup.
* Installed a plugin for VS Code that let me preview GitHub markdown. Super useful.
