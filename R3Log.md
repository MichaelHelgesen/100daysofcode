### D6 #100DaysOfCode - 6.5.18

_Morning (07.00 - 09.00):_

* Continued to review the basics of JS.
* Updated my dictionary with a lot of entries.

### D5 #100DaysOfCode - 5.5.18

_Morning (06.00 - 08.30):_

* Started viewing basic JS-videos again to refresh terminology, concepts, methods and so on.
* Created a dictionary in which I explain to myself the different coding terminology. Hopefully it will help me remember better. It's also fun to do.
* Went through my fCC account to prepare a restart of the algorithm scripting.

_Evening (21.30 - 23.00):_

* Continued watching videos, doing challenges and adding to my code dictionary. 

**Total:** 3 h

**Thoughts:**
As I go through some of the basics again, I realise how much I have forgotten, but at the same time how much I know and have learned since I started last September. That gave me a boost. And while flipping through Haverbekes book, I noticed that I now understand a lot more than I did last time, which then led me to quit reading it. 

I've also (totally subconsciously), began to solve a couple of the advanced challenges on fCC. I seem to have a couple of ideas on how to solve them. At least in my head :D

All in all a good day.

### D4 #100DaysOfCode - 4.5.18

*Morning (05.45 - 06.15):*

* Slept bad tonight, so I had to get up a little later than usual. When I sat down to code, Visual Code had updated, and the Git link was broken. I couldn't get it working again. So not much productive work this morning. 

_Evening (21.00 - 23.00)_
* Managed to get Git working again.
* Updated my GitHub with more repositories.
* Added explanations to my dictionary. 

_Resources:_
* Udemy.
* Podcast: "Learn to Code With Me" S4E17.

**Total:** 2.30 h

**Thoughts:**
 I've been thinking all day. I've decided to drop the Node.js course for now to focus on pure JavaScript. I'm going to restart fCC, watch my JS videos on Udemy again to refresh my knowledge. I also need to review my goals. 


### D3 #100DaysOfCode - 3.5.18

*Morning (05.30 - 06.00):*

* Trying to solve a bigger challenge given by the instructor. It involves setting a default address in the weather app by writing to file. I had to review earlier tutorials to get going. It's tough, but as I wrote yesterday; this is what I learn the most from, not just following along. I managed to set up writing to file, now I need some code to be able to overwrite it, and call it if no new address is set.

*Evening (20.30 - 22.00):*

* I managed to solve the challenge. It's not pretty, but it works. There is now a default address set if the user don 't input one, and there is a possibility to overwrite the standard if one wishes.
* Moved onto section 5 about web servers and application deployment. 
* Made my first local server!

**Total:** 3 h

**Thoughts:** I did not get much joy out of solving the challenge. I know that the code was bad, and I got a bit frustrated. As I commented yesterday; many of the things I go through in the tutorials are soon forgotten. I concentrate more on following the instructor. I need to change that. 

It's exciting to move on to the server stuff, but I realize that need a better JS fundamen before moving forward with Node. I need to think! 


### D2 #100DaysOfCode - 2.5.18

*Morning (05.30 - 06.15):*

* Learned about ES6 Promises. A function that works as an alternative to callback functions. It's a function that takes one argument, and it is either resolved or rejected and it can't be called more than once, as opposed to regular callbacks. It's advanced when not having enough experience.

*Midday (2 h):*

* Continued with advanced ES6 Promises, and Promise chaining and "catch". Catch is an alternative to the error handler which is preferable to use when chaining to avoid errors.
* Managed to solve a challenge related to chaining Promises. Even though it was a success, it's important for me to realize that it was mostly studying what I went through earlier in the tutorial. But I did not just copy/paste, so I feel that I grasped the Promise method a _little_ better after this challenge.
* Did a quiz related to Promises. Got 5 out of 6 correct.
* Installed Axios, a library simplifying Promises so that we don't need to wrap "resolve" and "reject" in "new Promise" functions.
* Chaining Promises with Axios makes the code easier to handle, since we don't get as much indentations. But it is pretty complex. I fell off pretty quick in this tutorial, but managed to get a better understanding afterwards by reading through the code and commenting and not just keeping up with the instructor.

_Evening (21.00 - 22.00)_

* Trying to solve one of the instructors last challenges for the curent section. It's super though. Will continue tomorrow.

**Total:** 3.45 h

**Thoughts:** The last tutorials were complicated, but I managed to get through. But trying to solve the last big challenge from the instructor tells me that tutorials is a bit dangerous. They make you feel like you learn a lot, in a sneaky kind of way. It's not that I don't learn anything, but when trying to do stuff on my own, I realize how little I know. So I will try to add these new features, and only then continue with the course. That will teach me the most. 

### D1 #100DaysOfCode - 1.5.18

*Morning (04.45 - 06.36):*

* Continued my Node course on Udemy, building a weather app. It's fetching the address and live weather data via APIs. That is super cool, and it's so exciting to finally get some experience connecting things together through HTTP requests and APIs. 
* Installed [JSON view](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome) Chrome extension. Super useful when working with JSON data.
* I've used a lot of callback functions in this project. I need to get a better understanding of how that works in relation to the call stack, event loop etc.  
* I managed to solve all the challenges the instructor gave. 

*Afternoon (17.00 - 18.00):*

* Updated the theme on my WP-blog.
* Updated my GitHub Log and README for round 3.
* Learnt the GitHub markdown and GitHub emoji markup.
* Installed a plugin for VS Code that let me preview GitHub markdown. Super useful. 

*Evening (21.00 - 22.00):*

* Chained callbacks together in the Node.js weather app, creating a dynamic app that fetches weather based on the address the user types in.

**Total:** 3.50 h

**Thoughts:** Node.js is very cool. And chaining different callbacks together is powerful. But it gets complicated fast. I stopped several times, needing to get an overview and understand how it was all connected. The "I am a fraud" feeling is creeping in, but I manage to push it back. 

I can't wait to be able to implement Node in future projects.
