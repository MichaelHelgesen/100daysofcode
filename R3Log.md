Morning (04.45 - 06.36):

Continued my Node course on Udemy, building a weather app. It's fetching the address and live weather data via APIs. That is super cool, and it's so exciting to finally get some experience connecting things together through HTTP requests and APIs. 

I've used a lot of callback functions in this project. I need to get a better understanding of how that works in relation to the call stack, event loop etc.  

I managed to solve all the challenges the instructor gave.
