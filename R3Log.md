### D23 #100DaysOfCode - 23.5.18

_Morning (04.30 - 06.00)_

* Did a challenge
* Learned about live updating windows with .window and the "storage" event.

Evening (21.45 - 22.30)_

* Started exploring dates. Thats also new to me.

**Total:**  2.15 h 

**Thoughts:** It's amazing what you can do with programming. Switching out local storage with server will be fun. 

The code for this note app is getting complicated, and the instructor is moving a bit fast. I have to take it slow and review all the new code, not just type it in.  

Started to learn about "new Date()". There are som many methods!

### D22 #100DaysOfCode - 22.5.18

_Evening (21.30 - 22.00)_

* Continued exploring updating local storage.

**Total:**  30 min 

**Thoughts:** I only got 30 minutes of coding done today. I got a bit late yesterday, so I had to get some sleep. I also had stuff to do this evening. I'll catch up tomorrow. 

### D21 #100DaysOfCode - 21.5.18

_Morning (06.45 - 09.00):_

* Got stuck in a challenge by stupid mistake. 
* Solved a couple of additional challenges
* Started exploring .location and dynamic linking between pages.

_Evening (21.30 - 22.15)_

* Learned how to use location and some of its properties and methods. 
* Did a .location challenge.

**Total:**  3 h 

**Thoughts:** I spent almost an hour debugging, only to find out that I was somehow missing a whole function. I must have deleted it by accident. I didn't realize, and used a different function, so I didn't get any errors, only the wrong result. _Facepalm_ when I realized it.

My head was not with me today. I worked slow and had trouble concentrating. The code gets more complex, and the doubts begin to creep in again. Again: I have to use this in my own projects to really learn it. 

But I started exploring .location and dynamic linking. That is exciting and useful.

### D20 #100DaysOfCode - 20.5.18

_Morning (06.30 - 09.00):_

* Learned about debugging. I hadn't used that before, so that was very useful.
* Solved a DOM challenge.
* Added third party library called uuid. It creates a random ID.

_Evening (22.30 - 23.00):_
* Went through how to use the third party ID to delete items. 
* Started a new challenge.

**Total:**  3 h 

**Thoughts:** I was a little surprised to include a third party library at this point, especially to create an ID for each todo in the todo app to be able to delete the todo. 

I thought that could be done with ".this" or some sort of counting. That when you clicked the delete button, it was easy to make code that said "delete the note that I currently clicked". 

The instructor said that it was perfectly fine to use third party libraries, and that it's something everyone does. Why invent the wheel and use a lot of time to create something that has already been made. It's better to focus on making your program good, no matter which way.

That sounds reasonable. But for learning, I will try to keep third party libraries to a minimum, if it doesn't need something super complex. The Node course included a lot of it, so I will learn to implement libraries soon enough. First I want to have JavaScript in my fingers. 

### D19 #100DaysOfCode - 19.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 07.00):_

* Did a bunch of refactoring and completed a refactoring challenge 

**Total:**  1.5 h 

**Thoughts:** I only got to code this morning. We had a wonderful day in Oslo together. I was t tired to to any more coding when I got home. 

### D18 #100DaysOfCode - 18.5.18

_Morning (06.30 - 09.00):_

* Continued the form challenge and solved it. I of course had an inferior solution compared to the instructor, but it was not far off. It was at least the same logic. 
* Spent a lot of time studying the instructors code and code from other attendees in the Q&A. 

_Evening (21.30 - 23.00)_

*  Finished the form section, and moved on to local storage.
* Learned about CRUD: create, read, update and delete. The four operations that makes up the data storage mechanism.   
* Did a JSON challenge.

**Total:**  4 h 

**Thoughts:** Today I finished forms and went on to JSON and local storage. Again I am so glad I chose to take this course before continuing the one for Node. Now I am going through a lot of the stuff that the Node course took for granted that you knew. Going through it and putting everything in my dictionary will make me much more robust for the Node course. 

I also spent some time today examining the consept of commonplace books. That seems very exciting and it's just what I am looking for to be able to better learn from what I read. The question is do I make it digitaly or with handwriting. Need to think about that. I have come to realize that without processing what I read some way or another, it's just reading words, and learning less.  

### D17 #100DaysOfCode - 17.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 07.00):_

* Did a form challenge
* Added entries to my dictionary  

_Evening (22.00 - 22.30)_
* Checkboxes 
* A new challenge. Got to tired to finish.

**Total:**  2 h 

**Thoughts:** Been out all day celebrating Norways national day. So not much coding today either. But it's more than nothing after all. Working with fomrs and trying to implement checkbox functionality in a challenge. Got to tired to solve the last part. 

### D16 #100DaysOfCode - 16.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 06.15):_
 
* My laptop would not boot, so I spent all my time trying to fix it, with no luck so far.
 
Midday (2 h):_

* Spent lunch and some other free time to fix the laptop. Now it's working again. 

**Total:** 2.45 h (making my laptop work)

**Thoughts:** Almost been no coding today and that bothers me. And at the same time I'm kinda glad it does. That means that it has become a habit and that I am really enjoying it. 

### D15 #100DaysOfCode - 15.5.18

_Morning (04.30 - 06.15):_
 
* Got stuck with a challenge
* Fixed it after realizing I used the wrong method. 
 
_Evening (21.30 - 22.00):_

* Continued course, working with forms.
 

**Total:** 2.15 h

**Thoughts:** I was stuck today, and had to take a peak at the solution. Of course I should have figured it out. I used .forEach() instead of .filter(), which is a big difference. The first one returns a boolean, the second a new array. So no wonder nothing worked.

### D14 #100DaysOfCode - 14.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 06.00):_
 
* Continued DOM manipulation.
* Added entries to dictionary. 
* Did a couple of challenges. 

_Midday_ (20 min)
* Got to use .appendChild(), .forEach() and .remove(), which I just leared on a project today. Just a smal thing, but cool non the less. 

_Evening (21.00 - 22.00):_
* Continued course with advanced filtering and DOM manipulation. Some tougher challenges. 

**Total:** 2.50 h

**Thoughts:** The challenges and lectures are really getting advanced. And I start to notice how fast and easy I forget, when things move faster. That's why it's so important to actually use it in projects. 

I got to write a smal code at work today. It included what I just learned, so that was fortunate. It was fun to be able to solve it. I would not have been able to just a couple of months ago. 

### D13 #100DaysOfCode - 13.5.18

_Morning (06.30 - 09.00):_
 
* learned about .reduce() by reading the comments for the current tutorial section. I haven't used that earlier. Nice method.
* Learned how to set up a local web server. Super useful!
* Added entries to dictionary

_Evening (20.30 - 22):_
* Learned the methods .createElement() and .appendChild(). I haven't used those yet.
* Created DOM elements based on filtering and looping through arrays in the javascript file.
* Decided to buy a new laptop and create a new setup at home, with home server and a docking station for the laptop. 

**Total:** 4 h

**Thoughts:** Today I learned about and used a couple of new methods. That was great fun and super useful. I think I would be able to simplify my book list projects with some of these methods. I will look into it later. Right now I am set to finish this course before doing anything else. 

I can't believe that is almost a year since I decided to start this project. Last summer, while cutting the grass, I listened to an episode of Code Newbie. They interviewed Kallaway about his 100 Days of Code. I was spellbound. I listened to that episode several times, taking notes of everything they said.

While cutting the grass again yesterday, I thought about how far I have come. It's only a smal step, but it's a step none the less, and in the right direction. There is no other way than to keep working, every day. And maybe in another year from now, I will have taken a _couple_ of steps. Who knows.   

### D12 #100DaysOfCode - 12.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 09.00):_
 
* Continued the course and completed new challenges.
* Added entries to the dictionary.
Solved advanced challenges using my own dictionary! Cool!

_Evening (21.00 - 23.00):_


**Total:** 5.5 h

**Thoughts:** I am so glad I decided to take this basic course again. There is just so many things I understand better now. At this point in the course, the challenges are getting more advanced. Today I got stuck on a array problem. But I managed to solve it by reading my own dictionary. How cool is that! That means that I probably understood it when I wrote the entry, and that I managed to explain it good enough so that I understood it when reading it. But got to keep the ego down and code on.

I finished the second part of the challenge pretty easy. I spent time trying to figure out if I could refactor it. I did come up with another solution, but it actually required more code than the original.  

### D11 #100DaysOfCode - 11.5.18

_Morning (06.00 - 07.00):_
 
* Continued the course and completed new challenges.
* Added entries to my dictionary.
* Got stuck in the last array challenge.

_Evening (21.30 - 22.30):_
* Solved the challenge I was stuck on. I came up with a different solution than the instructor though.

**Total:** 2 h

**Thoughts:** Got stuck with a challenge today. That was kind of nice. Thought about it all day at work. I solved it when I came home, albeit using another solution than the instructor. But that's OK. Now I learned two ways to do it! I haven't worked much with arrays, so this is very usefull. 

### D10 #100DaysOfCode - 10.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 08.00):_
 
* Continued the course and completed new challenges.
* Added entries to my dictionary.

_Evening (19.30 - 22.00):_
* Venturing into arrays. Learned a couple of new things I didn't know. 
* Did a lot of challenges. Pretty easy.

**Total:** 5 h

**Thoughts:** Got in 5 hours today. I'm happy with that. I am really hooked to this programming now. I think it has become a natural part of my life. I wake up, make coffee and code. When the kids are in bed, I sit down to code. And I look forward to doing it every time. That is super fun. 

### D9 #100DaysOfCode - 9.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 06.30):_
 
* Continued the course and did a couple of challenges.
* Added entries to my dictionary.

_Afternoon (18.00 - 19.00):_
* Got in an hour of coding when the others were in town. Did a challenge related to objects and methods. 

_Evening (21.30 - 22.45)_
* Finished a couple of videos with a bunch of challenges. The course is good, and I really learn much more the second time around. 

**Total:** 3.15 h

**Thoughts:** Got up a little late today due to bad sleep. And it's really warm. 

I am enjoying the tutorial. The instructor is good, and he explains things in a different and simpler way. Besides, since I've been through this one time already, I have a much bigger understanding of what he is talking about. And I pick up on things that I either had forgotten, misunderstood, or not learned properly. So thats fun. But again, it's also a bit easy, so the feeling of "doing great" and progressing is a false one. 

### D8 #100DaysOfCode - 8.5.18

_Morning (05.30 - 06.30):_

* Continued to review the basics of JS.
* Updated my dictionary with a lot of entries.

_Miday (2 h):_
* Startet coding a calculator to be used on a clients website!

_Evening (21.30 - 22.45):_

* Finished the calculator and sent it to my colleague whos in charge of the customer. I only finished the functions. It's without styling for now.

**Total:** 4.15 h

**Thoughts:**
My colleagues at work have figured out that I'm learning to code. I've tried to be quiet and modest about it, but now the requests is starting to come... Today one of my colleagues asked me if I could look at a simple calculator for a client. The purpose was (simply put) to calculate a trucks total loading weight based on the weight of the truck, the trailer and more. 

I noticed that when the question came, I immediately went into some sort of defensive stanse. I became tense, sceptical and got a snappy tone in my voice. Luckily I realized it pretty fast, and tried to get out of it. It was just so scary to get that question. But at the same time it was very exciting. This is after all what I am working towards, and I started right away. I managed to finish it by this evening. It needs some cleaning up and refactoring, but it works and can be testet while I pretty it up. 

So now I actually appreciate the request. It was / is a nice challenge and good practice for me.    

### D7 #100DaysOfCode - 7.5.18

_Morning (05.15 - 06.15):_

* Continued to review the basics of JS.
* Updated my dictionary with a lot of entries.

_Evening (21.00 - 22.00):_

* Did a couple of challenges.
* Added to the dictionary.

**Total:** 2 h

**Thoughts:**
I learned something new today, and that was setting default parameter values when defining a function. I can't remember learning that earlier. Very useful.

Really loving programming and JavaScript, even though I'm back at basics. My plan is to finish the course, then start a new project. 

Also read some really interesting pages of "Ego is the enemy" today, which I really related to and is important to remember going forward. 

### D6 #100DaysOfCode - 6.5.18

_Morning (07.00 - 09.00):_

* Continued to review the basics of JS.
* Updated my dictionary with a lot of entries.

_Evening (21.00 - 22.30):_

* Continued the course.
* Added yet more to the dictionary.

**Total:** 3.5 h

**Thoughts:**
Even though I know every concept I am currently going through in the Udemy course, I learn so much more by doing it again, and using it as a base for my dictionary. I learn new ways of explaining things, and new definitions and new words. This is actually just what I felt was missing. So I'm kinda happy about the choice after all. Even though, again, going through this tutorial makes me feel like I am learning a lot. The truth is that using it in my own projects are what works best. But I'll blast through it, then start building again.

### D5 #100DaysOfCode - 5.5.18

_Morning (06.00 - 08.30):_

* Started viewing basic JS-videos again to refresh terminology, concepts, methods and so on.
* Created a dictionary in which I explain to myself the different coding terminology. Hopefully it will help me remember better. It's also fun to do.
* Went through my fCC account to prepare a restart of the algorithm scripting.

_Evening (21.30 - 23.00):_

* Continued watching videos, doing challenges and adding to my code dictionary. 

**Total:** 3 h

**Thoughts:**
As I go through some of the basics again, I realise how much I have forgotten, but at the same time how much I know and have learned since I started last September. That gave me a boost. And while flipping through Haverbekes book, I noticed that I now understand a lot more than I did last time, which then led me to quit reading it. 

I've also (totally subconsciously), began to solve a couple of the advanced challenges on fCC. I seem to have a couple of ideas on how to solve them. At least in my head :D

All in all a good day.

### D4 #100DaysOfCode - 4.5.18

*Morning (05.45 - 06.15):*

* Slept bad tonight, so I had to get up a little later than usual. When I sat down to code, Visual Code had updated, and the Git link was broken. I couldn't get it working again. So not much productive work this morning. 

_Evening (21.00 - 23.00)_
* Managed to get Git working again.
* Updated my GitHub with more repositories.
* Added explanations to my dictionary. 

_Resources:_
* Udemy.
* Podcast: "Learn to Code With Me" S4E17.

**Total:** 2.30 h

**Thoughts:**
 I've been thinking all day. I've decided to drop the Node.js course for now to focus on pure JavaScript. I'm going to restart fCC, watch my JS videos on Udemy again to refresh my knowledge. I also need to review my goals. 


### D3 #100DaysOfCode - 3.5.18

*Morning (05.30 - 06.00):*

* Trying to solve a bigger challenge given by the instructor. It involves setting a default address in the weather app by writing to file. I had to review earlier tutorials to get going. It's tough, but as I wrote yesterday; this is what I learn the most from, not just following along. I managed to set up writing to file, now I need some code to be able to overwrite it, and call it if no new address is set.

*Evening (20.30 - 22.00):*

* I managed to solve the challenge. It's not pretty, but it works. There is now a default address set if the user don 't input one, and there is a possibility to overwrite the standard if one wishes.
* Moved onto section 5 about web servers and application deployment. 
* Made my first local server!

**Total:** 3 h

**Thoughts:** I did not get much joy out of solving the challenge. I know that the code was bad, and I got a bit frustrated. As I commented yesterday; many of the things I go through in the tutorials are soon forgotten. I concentrate more on following the instructor. I need to change that. 

It's exciting to move on to the server stuff, but I realize that need a better JS fundamen before moving forward with Node. I need to think! 


### D2 #100DaysOfCode - 2.5.18

*Morning (05.30 - 06.15):*

* Learned about ES6 Promises. A function that works as an alternative to callback functions. It's a function that takes one argument, and it is either resolved or rejected and it can't be called more than once, as opposed to regular callbacks. It's advanced when not having enough experience.

*Midday (2 h):*

* Continued with advanced ES6 Promises, and Promise chaining and "catch". Catch is an alternative to the error handler which is preferable to use when chaining to avoid errors.
* Managed to solve a challenge related to chaining Promises. Even though it was a success, it's important for me to realize that it was mostly studying what I went through earlier in the tutorial. But I did not just copy/paste, so I feel that I grasped the Promise method a _little_ better after this challenge.
* Did a quiz related to Promises. Got 5 out of 6 correct.
* Installed Axios, a library simplifying Promises so that we don't need to wrap "resolve" and "reject" in "new Promise" functions.
* Chaining Promises with Axios makes the code easier to handle, since we don't get as much indentations. But it is pretty complex. I fell off pretty quick in this tutorial, but managed to get a better understanding afterwards by reading through the code and commenting and not just keeping up with the instructor.

_Evening (21.00 - 22.00)_

* Trying to solve one of the instructors last challenges for the curent section. It's super though. Will continue tomorrow.

**Total:** 3.45 h

**Thoughts:** The last tutorials were complicated, but I managed to get through. But trying to solve the last big challenge from the instructor tells me that tutorials is a bit dangerous. They make you feel like you learn a lot, in a sneaky kind of way. It's not that I don't learn anything, but when trying to do stuff on my own, I realize how little I know. So I will try to add these new features, and only then continue with the course. That will teach me the most. 

### D1 #100DaysOfCode - 1.5.18

*Morning (04.45 - 06.36):*

* Continued my Node course on Udemy, building a weather app. It's fetching the address and live weather data via APIs. That is super cool, and it's so exciting to finally get some experience connecting things together through HTTP requests and APIs. 
* Installed [JSON view](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome) Chrome extension. Super useful when working with JSON data.
* I've used a lot of callback functions in this project. I need to get a better understanding of how that works in relation to the call stack, event loop etc.  
* I managed to solve all the challenges the instructor gave. 

*Afternoon (17.00 - 18.00):*

* Updated the theme on my WP-blog.
* Updated my GitHub Log and README for round 3.
* Learned the GitHub markdown and GitHub emoji markup.
* Installed a plugin for VS Code that let me preview GitHub markdown. Super useful. 

*Evening (21.00 - 22.00):*

* Chained callbacks together in the Node.js weather app, creating a dynamic app that fetches weather based on the address the user types in.

**Total:** 3.50 h

**Thoughts:** Node.js is very cool. And chaining different callbacks together is powerful. But it gets complicated fast. I stopped several times, needing to get an overview and understand how it was all connected. The "I am a fraud" feeling is creeping in, but I manage to push it back. 

I can't wait to be able to implement Node in future projects.
