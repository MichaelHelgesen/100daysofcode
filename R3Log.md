### D1 #100DaysOfCode - 1.5.18
*Morning (04.45 - 06.36):*

* Continued my Node course on Udemy, building a weather app. It's fetching the address and live weather data via APIs. That is super cool, and it's so exciting to finally get some experience connecting things together through HTTP requests and APIs. 
* Installed [JSON view](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome) Chrome extension. Super useful when working with JSON data.
* I've used a lot of callback functions in this project. I need to get a better understanding of how that works in relation to the call stack, event loop etc.  
* I managed to solve all the challenges the instructor gave. 

*Afternoon (17.00 - 18.00):*
* Updated the theme on my WP-blog.
* Updated my GitHub Log and README for round 3.
* Learnt the GitHub markdown and GitHub emoji markup.
* Installed a plugin for VS Code that let me preview GitHub markdown. Super useful. 

*Evening (21.00 - 22.00):*
* Chained callbacks together in the Node.js weather app, creating a dynamic app that fetches weather based on the address the user types in.

**Total:** 3.50 h

**Thoughts:** Node.js is very cool. And chaining different callbacks together is powerful. But it gets complicated fast. I stopped several times, needing to get an overview and understand how it was all connected. The "I am a fraud" feeling is creeping in, but I manage to push it back. 

I can't wait to be able to implement Node in future projects.

### D2 #100DaysOfCode - 2.5.18
*Morning (05.30 - 06.45):*

* Learned about ES6 Promises. A function that works as an alternative to callback functions. It's a function that takes one argument, and it is either resolved or rejected and it can't be called more than once, as opposed to regular callbacks. It's advanced when not having enough experience.
